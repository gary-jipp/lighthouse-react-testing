Mocha - Test Runner
Chai - Assersion Library
Jest - Test Runner with lots of built-in assertions

### Types of Testing
static - Linting
unit - testing the smallest piece of the app (function)
integration - testing pieces working together
end-to-end - testing the app the way a user would use it
regression testing - making sure new changes didn't break existing features

### Tools for Testing React
- Jest - test runner
- Testing Library
- React Testing Library

* Jest - test runner (similar to mocha, can use instead of mocha for any code)
 - look at package.json. Jest is already installed
 - why does React favor Jest?  Both are developed  by facebook - check github
 - https://jestjs.io/
 - getting started
 - looks a lot like Mocha!
 - API -> Expect + something
